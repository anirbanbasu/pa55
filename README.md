pa55
====
pa55 is a new way to solve the problem of remembering difficult-to-guess passwords. The idea is to deterministically generate strong passwords based on some easy-to-remember but difficult-to-guess information. All you, as the user, have to remember is some information, not the actual passwords, and pa55 can generate the relevant passwords whenever you need.
