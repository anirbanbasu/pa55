pa55
====
pa55 is a new way to solve the problem of remembering difficult-to-guess passwords. The idea is to deterministically generate strong passwords based on some easy-to-remember but difficult-to-guess information. All you, as the user, have to remember is some information, not the actual passwords, and pa55 can generate the relevant passwords whenever you need. For more information, see http://pa55.github.io/pa55/.

This repository contains a reference implementation of the main concept of pa55, and a description of the main concept behind pa55.
