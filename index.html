        <h2>Overview</h2>

<p>pa55 is a new way to solve the problem of remembering difficult-to-guess passwords. The idea is to deterministically generate strong passwords based on some easy-to-remember but difficult-to-guess information. All you, as the user, have to remember is some information, not the actual passwords, and pa55 can generate the relevant passwords whenever you need.</p>

<h3>The problem with passwords</h3>

<p>The problem is that we cannot remember passwords. We end up using very easy-to-remember and also very easy-to-infer (for the attacker) passwords. We keep using the same passwords for different services. When we realise that this is not a good thing to do then we start writing down passwords; and try to make complicated passwords which are not always that complicated. Sometimes, we also use password managers, many of which help us generate random strong passwords. If we ever need to remember a password that we stored with a password manager then we just unlock the specific password manager database. A solution indeed but not without some drawbacks:</p>
<ol>
<li>The password manager database contains many passwords associated with other private information such as account numbers, user names and so on, which are then locked with just one (perhaps not-so-strong?) password or sometimes just a four digit code. This creates a single point of failure.</li>
<li>Password managers store data on the cloud for convenience of operation between multiple devices. Although, they use encryption but storing such sensitive data on the cloud itself does not incite much trust in people even if the distrust may not always be reasonable.</li>
</ol>

<h3>What is the solution?</h3>

<p>Passwords are terrible and there is a lot of research trying to find alternative reliable means of authentication. Until passwords disappear, the solution to the problem discussed above is the industry-standard Password Based Key Derivation Function version 2 or PBKDF2 (RFC2898: <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2898.txt">https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2898.txt</a>) along with a well-known cryptographically secure hash function: SHA1, SHA256 or SHA512. In simple terms, one can define PBKDF2 as a function as follows.</p>
<pre><code>K = PBKDF2(P, S, R, A, L)
</code></pre>
<p>Here, K is the generated <i>key</i> of a desired length L from a <i>password</i> P mixed with <i>salt</i> S, using the HMAC hash function A with iterations R. Putting this in the perspective of pa55, we change the semantics of the terms as follows. P is the <i>master secret</i>, S is the <i>password hint</i>, L the desired size in characters while K is the <i>strong password</i> that pa55 generates for you. To keep it simple, let us ignore that pa55 allows you to change the values of R and A.</p>

<p>An alternative way to think of this is to consider pa55 as a black box, which accepts as inputs: a master secret, a password hint and some other parameters and outputs a strong random password. So long as the inputs remain the same, output remains unchanged. In other words, so long as you remember the master secret and the password hint, the same strong password will be generated for you. Furthermore, if you cannot distinguish the I from a 1, or a 0 from a o and so on in the generated password then pa55 can read it out in slow-paced clear English.</p>

<h4>Is there an example</h4>

<p>Let us try this example. Set the master secret P to "This should not be an easy sentence to figure out!" (ignore the double quotes). This secret is simple and easy to remember. (Of course, do not use this master secret literally!) Set the password hint S to "abcd!someservice2014" (again, without the quotes). Well, this is a bit cryptic but that "abcd" part is supposed to be easy-to-remember, for instance the birthday that you might have used so far for your passwords. (Add a bit more secret information to it if you are really going to use your birthday!) Basically, you could just use a single weak password that you might have been using so far as this cryptic part. The part "someservice" identifies the service for which this password is going to be used and "2014" is optional if you want to have a date context to the passwords. (You could use months, days and even time but then you will not be able to remember that detail!) The generated password of desired length 12 characters in this example, K, is "1kd/9SxlITZ4" (without the quotes) with 72 bits entropy for R set to 500K and A set to HMACwithSHA256. You will get a completely different password even if you just replaced the exclamation mark in the master secret with a period. Choosing a different value of the password length will, however, only result in a contraction or expansion of the generated password.</p>

<h3>Storing versus remembering passwords</h3>

<p>Do you need to store the generated password on the cloud? No, because you can just remember the master secret. The password hint is not that hard to associate with a particular service so long as you have your own ways of remembering its cryptic part. Your web browser or some other program will save your password for a particular service anyway. If that stored password is ever compromised then the attacker still does not learn the master secret or password hint. You could just use a different password hint (for instance, by changing the date stamp?) with the same master secret to generate a completely different password for use with that service.</p>

<p>If you forget your master secret or your password hints, pa55 cannot help you remember them. Should you be worried? Yes, absolutely! Do not forget the master secret or your password hints. There is no way to retrieve a password that you have generated using the forgotten master secret or the password hint.</p>

<h2>How to get it</h2>

<p>Click on the 'Download on the AppStore' button to download to your iOS device. If you were thinking what would happen if you lost your iOS device then worry not: pa55 does not store your passwords on the device. In fact, after two minutes of inactivity, pa55 will delete from your device your generated password as well as the master secret and the password hint and reset all other parameters to default values. The method of generating the passwords, i.e., PBKDF2 is a standard function. It is possible to generate the same passwords with the same inputs without an iOS device. Should you not have an iOS device, a stand-alone Java version will be released shortly, which you can use on a computer to generate the same passwords. An Android version will make its way to the Google Play Store eventually.</p>

<h2>How much does it cost?</h2>

<p>Nothing! pa55 is FREE and has been developed to solve a genuine problem that people face. The source code of this app will also be made public through this GitHub repository eventually so that you can see it for yourself what the app does.</p>

<h2>Where to get support</h2>

<p>Use our <a href="https://github.com/anirbanbasu/pa55/issues">issue tracker</a> to let us know your questions, comments, feature requests and above all, bugs. You will need to have a GitHub account to report issues.</p>

<h2>Privacy policy</h2>

<p>pa55 does not store or transmit any of the sensitive information that you use to generate your passwords. The app also does not track usage information. Apple might do, as part of their terms and conditions of app usage. Well, you will have to take our word on it until the source code is made open!</p>

<h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>

<h3>Are there other similar apps?</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://crypto.stanford.edu/PwdHash/">Stanford PwdHash</a> springs to mind. It is built to be used with web browsers.</p>

<h3>PwdHash protects the user from phishing attacks. What about pa55?</h3>

<p>No, it does not protect the user from phishing attacks. PwdHash is a browser extension that keeps track of which sites you visit. It generates a password based on the website you are visiting. In contrast, pa55 does not really have any control over which website you visit or which application you use your password in. Therefore, it cannot thwart phishing attacks.</p>

<h3>Can the secret information be 'sniffed' using a side-channel attack?</h3>

<p>The generated password, master secret and the password hint are all cleared after two minutes of inactivity (i.e., the app is in the background). However, this does not stop the attacker from using a sophisticated side-channel attack when the app is in use. Most of the time, this should not concern users. Mounting a side-channel attack is not trivial and the attacker needs to have your mobile device running pa55 in close proximity of the attacking equipment.</p>

<h3>Can the secret information be obtained using a DRAM freezing attack?</h3>

<p>pa55 is not protected against a DRAM freezing attack but as with the side channel attack, this requires the attacker to have physical access to your device and the ability to extract its memory module after freezing it. This should not be a concern for users. Do not forget that pa55 clears your password from memory after two minutes of inactivity, so the DRAM freezing ought to happen within that period.</p>

<h2>General note about attacks</h2>

<p>pa55 is an app that helps you generate strong passwords from easy-to-remember information. It does not protect your online privacy from against attacks launched to gain access to your accounts, such as phishing, inference based attacks and so on. For instance, methods have been demonstrated to gain access to a service starting with the pretence that the password has been lost. This type of attack arises from flaws in the service design or being vulnerable to phishing, not in your choice of password. There is nothing much you can do regarding your passwords no matter how strong the password, how you generate or how you store it. Enabling multi-factor authentication on services that support it can be of help, if such multi-factor schemes are implemented correctly.</p>
